After almost 2 years of being at home, we (me and my girlfriend) decided it was time to explore new places. Last time we went abroad we also went to Portugal. We visited Lisbon and Lagos (Algarve). We liked the people and the chill vibe in Portugal so we agreed on going back - this time to Porto and the Sao Miguel island in the Azores.

During these uncertain times there is quite a bit more frustration with all the rules, guidelines and the documentation (test, locator forms,...) you have to bring to lessen the chances of ruining the holidays by being stopped from traveling or being sent to quarantine. Overall the preparation for the holidays was not as we were used to but in the end we managed to sort everything out.


We spent our first three days in windy and sometimes rainy Porto. The weather wasn't as expected but on the bright side the lack of heat made it possible to walk around the city the whole day. The second day we decided to rent bikes and ride on the shore of Gaia, the city on the south side of the river Douro. We followed a long sandy beach until Capela do Senhor da Pedra, which was our final destination. SLIKA
On our way home we stopped in the marina to take a boat ride under 6 bridges of the Douro river. 

The next day started with us going to a laboratory, where we had to take a PCR test. A negative PCR test is a condition to enter the Azores. Afterwards we went for a brunch and enjoyed the city. We also took a ride with an old fashioned tram. Slika?

Fourth day was traveling day - we flew to the Azores archipelago, a group of 9 beautiful islands located (almost) in the middle of the Atlantic ocean - around 1500 km west of Porto. 

The temperatures were quite similar to those in Porto, but it felt like it was hotter here. Maybe also because the wind was not as strong and cold. 
My girlfriend had planned many activities and places to visit during our stay. We started by going to the Furnas region, known for its hot springs. SLIKA
Afterwards we went to Poca da Dona Beija, "A mystical space of leisure and relaxation that is immersed in the exuberant Azorean nature and features geothermally heated water from an iron-rich water spring". We finished our visit of Furnas with lunch in the nearby restaurant that offered food cooked in the hot springs.
We countinued to the north east part of the island, known for its beautiful views, but the weather quickly worsened and all we could see was fog. On the way back we stopped in sunny and windy Ribeira Grande.

The following day we went on the west side of the island, heading towards Sete Cidades and the nearby lakes.
