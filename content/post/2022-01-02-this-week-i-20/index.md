Aaaand it's a new year. Another one. Another opportunity. A new start. That's true for any moment though, IF you keep dedicating to it. Nothing changes in reality. It is an opportunity to spend time with friends and family. How many people we meet changed drastically the last 2 years so it's now usually celebrated in smaller circles or bubbles or nets or anything that puts a layer of separation. It's two competing forces, union and separation,  and the winner is a mix of both.

Many things happened in the last half of December. I wanted to name it Happy, but it doesn't seem to fit my description of it. For me it was happy, but this happiness has got nothing to do with the month itself. There was not much shopping left for me to do because this year I had planned my gifts with care and in advance. It's the first time I took this approach and it's made the process smooth and pretty much stress-less. Not to mention the gifts were a hit because I knew exactly what to get for everyone, be it an experience, local chocolate, natural local cosmetics or alpaca socks. Never knew alpaca socks were a thing and they are actually good at their job. It was not much but it was all good quality and local if possible, so there was a good intention behind it and that's important. So it wasn't bought just because it is appropriate but also because it will also add value to the recipient. I was also happy with the gifts I got - a new long sleeve shirt for running, a jacket for running (that I got in advance), some special foods,... Everything that will be put to good use, nothing that will haunt me on my shelves for too long.

I was in Ljubljana twice with my girlfriend. She works in a school so she had holidays and it was easier for us to move around. The first time we went for Christmas and we spent a couple of days there. We also took our sleds with us in case we decided to search for snow. We went north of Ljubljana, like a half hour drive, and found a nice quiet place with a white hill on the side. We had much fun there, I don't remember when was the last time (if there was one) when we went on a sled together. The descent wasn't long but it was quite steep so there was a brief adrenaline rush every time and a relief after. We didn't leave without making the usual snow creation - a snowman. We had everything we needed - snow, some rocks, straw and a few sticks, to make him good-looking.

While we were in Ljubljana we also visited Ikea. We went there because I'm planning to buy a new work desk but spent most of the time looking around, getting ideas and arguing about how our house will look like. I didn't end up getting a desk because I wasn't fully convinced and I still had some measuring to do at home. We didn't buy anything else, which is good, as we hadn't planned on buying anything else.To sum it up I think the concept of the store is ok, it's different than what I'm used to.. Like the warehouse where you take what you (don't) need. And the food and the bar was also unexpected. My girlfriend said they are known for having good meatballs, but I wasn't hungry then. Perhaps next time, when I'll be brave enough to buy a new desk.

The second time we went to Ljubljana was on New Year's eve. It's my brother's birthday on the very same day, so we couldn't leave earlier! We had it all planned and almost everything went by the plan. There were some nuisances and changes but it turned out a great night for the two of us. The menu was fish based - octopus salad and garlic bread for appetizers and grilled salmon with oven vegetables for the main dish. And for desserts we had some good looking (and tasting) cakes from a French patisserie. We had some good wine with the courses and some gin-based cocktails after. We listened to music and sang along and even danced a little. Just before midnight we went to the PreÅ¡ern square where many people gathered to watch the fireworks. For nothing. Although scheduled, there wasn't anything to see. Only the smaller fireworks that were very (too) close to us. I later found out the fireworks were cancelled due to fog. As you'd imagine, we didn't spend much more time waiting and headed back home to continue with our own party. 

The next day we chilled, watched some TV and ordered takeout. Then in the afternoon we headed back home. We stopped by my girlfriends house to wish a happy bew year (and for food.. dinner :) Later we watched some TV and went to bed to regenerate. It was over.
