This week was the same as the last few weeks. The work days atleast. Nothing new or interesting happened. That doesn't mean there has been no progress though - I actually almost finished my models that are used to assess risk factors of SME Slovenian companies. During the modeling phase I learned many new tools and ways to improve the model or find anomalies in the data. The process was tedious at moments but very insightful throughout and will surely help my future endeavors with this or similar data modeling.

At work I did some mandatory education courses and also attended a meeting from the EBRD about the ESG standards that are becoming ever so prominent in the banking industry. The speaker kept the presentation interesting with real life situations, for example problems with projects that have neglected the social or environmental impact and have had trouble or actually failed because of it. The team I work in will probably oversee at least in part the operations needed to comply with these standards. In fact a biologist will be joining our team that is comprising mostly of IT and credit risk analysts. We will be expanding our range. Hopefully.

My girlfriend came to Ljubljana on Friday - we were going to an event with another couple. We were schoolmates in high school and roommates during the student years in Ljubljana. We were attending a haloween-like event that literally translates to Haunted house in a shitty valley. But it was actually more like a haunted forest, since it was outdoors - on the border of Ljubljana. You walk along a trail in the dark and there are challenges for you to complete. And there are monsters - skeletons, wolverines and so on - haunting you along the way. So we actually ran most of the time. We haven't completed a single challenge and my friend was quite sad about it. Perhaps next year...

Saturday morning we went back home - to the Slovenian coast. Just not to enjoy a sunny and warm October weekend but to pick olives. We have around 60 olive trees around the house and that usually takes us around 3 full days to pick. So 1 in 52 weekends is spent doing this. I used to hate picking olives. I still don't like it now but it's getting better. Perhaps because we pick them earlier than we used to and the weather is warmer. Years ago we used to pick them in November and I remember it being cold and windy all the time. But this weekend I was in short sleeves all the time and I wasn't feeling cold at all. We also picked them just 1 and a half day since there haven't been many due to some disease I think. In the end it was like 290 kg and we got 53 liters of oil. As an example last year we had 750 kg and 75 liters. So about 1/3 of the weight but a munch better yield (16.5% vs 9 %).

Me and my girlfriend had some tasty burgers after a full day's work and then we watched the Squid Game series with my girlfriend. We got drawn into it and finished the last three episodes. It's safe to say it was worth watching. Now we will have to find a new one for these short winter (autumn) days!
