I spent most of this week in Ljubljana. In fact I only went home on Saturday and returned back to Ljubljana on Sunday. At work I continued the development of my automated report. It's a big project that is expected to be expanded even more so I'm trying to make it as scalable as possible. It's been working out great and I learned new ways of creating the final report from multiple smaller reports. This is very important as it allows easy additions and repetitions of the smaller reports with different parameters.

Later in the week I had to stop working on the project as I have to finish my master's thesis due to me receiving scolarship from my employee. I already know that I will miss the deadline as it was definitely set too early (I didn't know it would take so long due to the difficulty and other formal processes of approval etc.). The problem I've chosen is quite complex with lots of literature to review and to make it worse I can only work with the data when I'm at the workplace as I'm not allowed to take the data home. I will try to finish as much of the thesis in September as I will start working full-time in October. It's a bit stressful and I don't have much time for my girlfriend and my family but soon it will all work out great!
Talking about scholarship.. This week I recorded a video statement about the benefits and opportunities that come with a scholarship at my current employee. The video is in slovene and is accessible on [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek1YZu5grsQ).

Apart from work and school I continued training for the 10K run in October (45 min is my goal). I'm using a training program provided from Garmin and it's about 3 sessions per week. I bought myself new running shoes as the old ones started tearing apart on one side. I got back to mindfulness meditation in order to aid my stress. It's not that I'm very stressed but it will help me keep it this way. I also started listening to a podcast. I've never listened to any podcast before and I have to say I don't mind listening to one while doing something (that is not needing all my focus). Otherwise it's like multitasking and I'm not a fan of that as it makes you do things superficially.
