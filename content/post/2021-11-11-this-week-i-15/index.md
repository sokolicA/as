It's Thursday evening and I haven't yet taken the time to write my weekly journal. And I've been home most of the time. I stayed at home due to my co-worker getting sick and me having to self-isolate just in case so I don't pass anything on. And I have not. It's all been normal and we all stayed healthy.  But that's not the why I'm taking so long to write this. It's because I'm doing my best to finish my master's thesis and I get so involved in it the whole day passes by with the blink of an eye. I just realised this is supposed to be about last week and here I am writing about the past few days.

So last week I worked from home, I didn't even go to Ljubljana. And it was great. I forgot how much nicer it is here. It's way more sunny (it was quite windy though) and there's more daylight. This helps my overall mood and productivity and I've done quite a lot. I worked in the mornings and then spent the rest of the days with my girlfriend. We watched some series, movies, ordered pizzas,... 

Saturday was my cooking day as I set myself to cook butter chicken, an Indian dish I really like. It was like a month ago that I tried it for the first time and have eaten it a few times since then. I googled how to make it at home. The preparation didn't look too lengthy or complicated so I had to try it. And I succeeded to make a delicious dish that tasted exactly how I wanted it to taste. I also have to thank the recipe for that since there's a ton of spices that goes in and I just blindly followed the dosages. What I will change next time is I'll up the dosage of tomato sauce and cream as there was not enough of this delicious sauce. 

Me and my girlfriend went to Lucija after lunch. We walked to Forma Viva, a place located uphill of the camping place in Lucija. What's special about the place are the abstract sculptures made of stone. And the view of the coast is also nice. We sunbathed there for a few minutes and then continued down the coast. We stopped for coffee and a "white choco" hot drink and then continued towards our car.

On Sunday morning I went for a light run with my friend and then went to my girlfriend's house for lunch. She prepared salmon and potatoes in the oven. It came out delicious and I ate a lot of it. Salmon is one of my favorite fish and I started eating it weekly in the last few months. On top of that I was really hungry so I ended up eating a whole plate and then some more. And cheesecake for dessert. Perfect for after a run!
