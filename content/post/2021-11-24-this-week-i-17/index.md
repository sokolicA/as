This week passed by very very fast. Not much different than any of the past weeks I suppose. The more I do, the faster time goes by. And lately I'm always doing something. From more self-oriented stuff like working, writing my thesis, studying, reading, running etc., to spending quality time with my girlfriend, friends and family. And some alone time in between, which is not that easy to find, but I think it's very important to have. Atleast I enjoy it and I usually take this time early in the morning, when everyone is still asleep.

So I was in Ljubljana from Sunday to Tuesday as I had a dentist appointment on Monday. I'm trying to go to the dentist regularly, so I can keep my teeth under control. This time I had help from my jaw, which started aching about a month ago - feels like dull pain on the left side, mostly when eating. I was told it is a bit misaligned but there doesn't seem to be nothing major. So I just got some exercises to do every day for quite a while. They should help to correct the jaw's movement when I eat or just open my mouth. My teeth were fine - nothing had to be done about them. Lately I've been taking good care of them. 

I went home on Tuesday. My girlfriend picked me up and we went to my place and had Pad Thai and Roti thai that I ordered from a very good (best so far) thai "restaurant" in Ljubljana. It was good as always, even after being reheated in the microwave!

Then it was mostly work and watching movies or series in the afternoon! Until Saturday, when we went to Castello Miramare, near Trieste in Italy.  We hadn't visited it for a few years now. We headed there in hopes to catch the sun (it was supposed to be sunny) but it was quite the opposite. It didn't rain, but it was cloudy, just like at home. It was still really nice - we went for a walk around the castle and the nearby gardens. When we got hungry we went back to Izola and had lunch in a restaurant that also didn't see us for quite some time. We treated ourselves with some gnocchi with truffles and a steak. A friend invited me over to play some cards in the evening. He bought a few Pokemon decks and wanted to test them out.

Sunday morning I had a long run and later went to my girlfriend's where we had lunch - salmon and potatoes in the oven, some vegetables as a side dish and cheesecake for dessert! I ate a lot of it, just like always. It's the type of food I like and on top of that I was hungry from the run before. I always eat good on Sundays. And to make up for it I tend to fast for about 18-24 hours after. 18 is quite easy but getting to 24 can be a challenge, even more so if I'm active. What I have to watch out is that I don't eat like crazy after the fast, which is what I did in the beginning. Now I usually realize it before it's not too late and I've eaten enough food for 2 days in 20 minutes.
