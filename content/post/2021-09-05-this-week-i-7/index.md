The weather was very good this week so I was happy to be free of work-work. I was in Izola and mostly worked on my master's thesis and enjoyed my free time with my girlfriend. School started on Wednesday and she started working again. I am also going back to work tomorrow and am going to Ljubljana today where I will stay until Friday. At work I'll work on finishing my project and automate sending of the reports.

In preparation for my 10 K night run in October I ran two 10 K this week. First run I finished in 49 min and 30 secs and improved my time by half a minute the next run.

At home we painted the floor around the wooden cabin with some protective paint- something we had planned for before the summer... but didn't manage to do it then. It takes quite some time and work to mantain it (wood/cabin) but it is well worth it, since I spend many days there in the summer...
