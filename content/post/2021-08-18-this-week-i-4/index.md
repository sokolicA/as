This week, just as any other week in summer, went by so fast I'm not even sure I did anything. Well no wonder since I was working the whole week in Ljubljana and I was accompanied by my girlfriend so my days were fully booked. We watched some series, walked the city, went to the celebration /return of our Olympians,...
At work I almost finished (it's in the review phase) an automated interactive report that will be sent out monthly. I also started working on the quarterly report which is basically the same but additionally includes some monthly comparisons and some changes that need to be accounted by because of the larger time spans.
