After almost 2 years of being at home, we (me and my girlfriend) decided it was time to explore new places. Last time we went abroad we also went to Portugal. We visited Lisbon and Lagos (Algarve). We liked the people and the chill vibe in Portugal so we agreed on going back - this time to Porto and the Sao Miguel island in the Azores, a volcanic archipelago.

During these uncertain times there is quite a bit more frustration with all the rules, guidelines and the documentation (tests, locator forms,...) you have to bring to lessen the chances of ruining the holidays by being stopped from traveling or being sent to quarantine. Overall the preparation for the holidays was not as we were used to but in the end we managed to sort everything out.

We spent our first three days in windy and sometimes rainy Porto. The weather wasn't as expected but on the bright side the lack of heat made it possible to walk around the city the whole day. The second day we decided to rent bikes and ride on the shore of Gaia, the city on the south side of the river Douro. We followed a long sandy beach until Capela do Senhor da Pedra, which was our final destination. SLIKA
On our way home we stopped in the marina to take a boat ride on the Douro river. 

The next day started with us going to a laboratory, where we had to take a PCR test: a negative PCR test is a condition to enter the Azores. Afterwards we went for a brunch and enjoyed wandering around the city. We also took a ride with an old fashioned tram. Slika?

Fourth day was traveling day - we flew to the Azores archipelago, a group of 9 beautiful islands located (almost) in the middle of the Atlantic ocean - around 1500 kilometers west of Porto.

The temperature was quite similar as in Porto, but it felt hotter there. It could be due to higher humidity and the not so strong and "cold" wind.
My girlfriend had planned many activities and places to visit during our stay. We started by going to the Furnas region, known for its hot springs. SLIKA
Afterwards we went to Poca da Dona Beija, "A mystical space of leisure and relaxation that is immersed in the exuberant Azorean nature and features geothermally heated water from an iron-rich water spring". We finished our visit of Furnas with lunch in the nearby restaurant that offered food cooked in the hot springs, called Cozido de Furnas.
We countinued to the north east part of the island, known for its beautiful views or miradouros as they call it, but the weather quickly worsened and our view was obstructed by fog. On the way back we stopped in sunny and windy Ribeira Grande where we enjoyed a cocktail on the beach.

The following day we went on the west side of the island, heading towards Sete Cidades and the nearby lakes. The twin lakes lie in the crater of a dormant volcano and are different in color (blue and green). We visited an abandoned hotel on the top of a hill, overlooking the lakes on one side and sea on the other. Were able to get the nicest views of the area from the Miradouro da Grota do Inferno. SLIKA

We ended our full day trip with a visit of a tea plantation - a rare sight in Europe. We were able to walk around the plantation and also see the machinery that processes the leaves into tea. 

On our last day with the car and we decided to go to Vila Franca do Campo and visit the nearby island by boat. Due to bad weather we didn't stay for long and instead opted to go back to Furnas where we still had to visit Parque Terra Nostra, which includes a beautiful garden and hot thermal pools. After a nice walk around the park we went took some time to relax in the thermal pools. 
After leaving the park we tried different local cheese from the nearby Queijaria Furnense. SLIKA?

From the food point of view we really liked their food and tried to taste as many of their local products as possible: cheese, passion fruit, tuna steak, beef (steaks and burgers), Cozido da Furnas, Queijadas, Wine from Pico island,...
We also liked the pineapple plantation in Ponta Delgada. After taking a tour around the greenhouses and learning the process of farming pineapple (I was shocked when I found out growing one takes longer than 2 years) we also tried pineapple liquor and jam.


After all the worrying about being even able to travel and the rapidly changing conditions we successfully managed to escape our ordinary lives for 10 days and have new experiences. We were prepared enough not to have any trouble and we enjoyed the holidays as much as we could.


Now it's time to think about our next destination...
