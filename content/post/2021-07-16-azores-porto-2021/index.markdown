After almost 2 years of being at home, we (me and my girlfriend) decided it was time to explore new places. Last time we went abroad we also went to Portugal. We visited Lisbon and Lagos (Algarve). We liked the people and the chill vibe in Portugal so we agreed on going back - this time to Porto and the Sao Miguel island in the Azores.

During these uncertain times there is quite a bit more frustration with all the rules, guidelines and the documentation (test, locator forms,...) you have to bring to lessen the chances of ruining the holidays by being stopped from traveling or being sent to quarantine. Overall the preparation for the holidays was not as we were used to but in the end we managed to sort everything out.
