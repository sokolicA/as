I was so focused on my masters thesis that I put many of the non urgent tasks on hold. That doesn't mean I didn't take care for my health, mind and close relationships. That means I spent no time on social networks or exploring the world wide web for things I will forget about after the next thought comes to mind. That remark just made me realize I've been becoming less digital. I respect technology and the developments that are made with the intention to make our life easier. But sometimes the intention doesn't unfold in such a way that actually makes it (life? existence?) easier. Or better. Though it can, by shifting our focus and way of thinking so slowly and gradually (and with everyone so involved in something most don't even realize), make it look useful, it can also lead to despair. You have to respect it. It is new. We are not.

I'll take this last call to end this Saturday morning stream of thought before it becomes macabre and continue with my weekie.
I went for 3 runs, one of which was a 22 km run that accounted for November's half marathon. I think this makes the 7th consecutive month I've ran a half marathon. It's became quite effortless to run it in a decent amount of time. The runs I'm doing are still part of the 14 week training programme that ends in two weeks with a 10 km race with goal time of less than 45 minutes. I also continued my meditation journey - the 20 minutes first thing in the morning helps me clear my mind that is constantly running ideas and scenarios and ... currently it (my mind) quite often shifts to new possibilities about my thesis. It helped my work to become thorough and understanding. But when does this stop? For the thesis - it stops now. From now on only corrections are allowed and perhaps some changes that will make for a better presentation. The rest of my ideas will be kept for my next project. After the meditation I drink some tea and/or coffee and read a book. I've started reading in the morning because I find it easier to have a scheduled time then. It helps, I've finished reading Range.
I'll take this opportunity to end with a thought that came to mind while running.
