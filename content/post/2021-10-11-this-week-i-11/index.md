I worked my first full week. It hasn't changed much though. I was still working on my master's thesis and not doing much actual work. I had many forms to fill and had to send many requests for permission to access different programs and files. So we could say I productively spent my time while waiting for approvals. On Friday we had lunch in a fancy restaurant right on the other side of the entrance to my job. We had 4 courses - from appetizer to dessert. The presentation and plating of the dishes was very appealing and the taste didn't disappoint either. I immediately started with food and forgot to mention I got to meet many of my coworkers in person for the first time. I think we had a good time there.

After the lunch I rushed home to get ready to go back to Izola. I try to leave as early as possible on Fridays so that I have more time to be with my girlfriend and my family. Another advantage of leaving early is that there is less crowd before the rush hours. As soon as I arrived home I ate another lunch (we have late-lunch at home) with my family and then met with my girlfriend. We first went to an event in Koper with some friends. Some "local" musicians were supposed to perform but me and my girlfriend decided to leave before they even started as they were late and it wasn't promising.

We spent the whole Saturday together. We had coffee with our high school friend and then bought a gift (flowers and chocolate) for her mother - her birthday was the next day, on Sunday. For lucnh we  tried some pre-made american pizza with cheese in the border and it was actually pretty good. We used to eat premade pizzas quite often when we were together in Ljubljana. Things have changed. Not sure about the pizzas but in most cases they changed for the better. In the evening we started watching a series that was recommended by our friends. Squid Game. A Korean? series. I'm usually not fond of non english speaking series but this one is also available in a dubbed - English - version. It's also been quite long since we last watched any series. I believe we stopped with the last season of Vikings. Anyways, we watched the first two episodes and I think it will be worth to watch it to the end. So we will continue watching it the next weekend, if we will find the time to do so.

On Sunday I went for a 16 K run that was planned by my "virtual coach". Meanwhile my girlfriend went home and helped to prepare for lunch. I had it all planned. Run, shower, eat. And eat some more. Soup, oven baked potatoes, cooked veggies, Wiener Schnitzel, salad and cheesecake for dessert. We all enjoyed it. 
After lunch we went for a walk with my dog and then I had to get ready to go back to Ljubljana. I went there with a bus this time because my brother needs the car for the new job. Uni started and the bus was fuller than I was used to in the summer. I still got to sit alone though. That is all I wanted to end the week: to sit, alone and undisturbed, and listen to a calming podcast.
