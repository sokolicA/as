I basically again spent the whole days thinking about my thesis. Now I can really say I only need to describe a few tables and graphs I added in. I can't help myself from thinking about how I could improve it. This week was more about how to make the graphs and tables that are coherent and contain the relevant information. It's not an easy task but it helps for a broader audience. I have really been learning a lot from it. I just have to learn to stop thinking about these things so much. 

I started reading a new book about the mind. It's my second attempt at it and now I'm taking my time and am reading it slowly to digest it in time. It's interesting and I want to understand the message on the spot so I can better understand what follows. I also did my scheduled runs. After more than a month I went to run with my 2 friends that I started running with. We waited for the rain to stop so we went later than scheduled. And we got caught by the rain but it wasn't that cold and I liked it. Now I only have 2 really easy trainings scheduled until Saturday, the day of the 10 km race. It shouldn't be a problem. 

After working and a short run I went to Ljubljana with my girlfriend and parents. They booked a hotel for one night and walked around the centre and enjoyed the December (Christmas?) spirit. Me and my girlfriend took the opportunity and went along. I had some things to take home with me and tell my roommates that I am thinking of moving out since I don't really need the appartment there with the work from home. They took it lightly - they actually already talked about it and will perhaps stay just the two of them. That's great because it makes my moving out easier! Well apart from that we also went to check the centre with many lights. We really just checked them as the delivery called sooner than expected and we rushed back home in a hurry. The weather was really nice on Saturday and we went for a walk around the city and the castle. We enjoyed the views of the city and the hot rays from the sun. I really liked walking around the city. It's a beautiful city. But you can't really enjoy it on weekdays as it's too crowded and everyone's in a hurry and all that chaos. But walking around on a quiet and sunny Saturday morning was perfect.
