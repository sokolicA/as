I got back to work so I stayed in Ljubljana this week. Although I continued working on my projects for report automation, I spent most of my time learning new tricks in R and SQL and about the tables in the DWH. There's a ton of data and it can really get messy when everyone has its own self-made tables but no table has all the information I need. And there comes another table :)

I spent the rest of the days being active (walking, running) and working on my master's thesis, which is going great. It's almost at the point where the analysis and all the fun starts. Apart from that I started reading Range, a book that I've bought not too long ago. I barely started but I think it's going to be a good read, I'll write more about it when I finish. <br>
I went back to Izola for the weekend. On my way home I stopped on a birthday party in Ri≈æana. A friend of mine was celebrating her 30th birthday and my girlfriend was already there. She's been working in Izola so she sadly couldn't come to Ljubljana with me. We hang around, watched some series, had a long walk to the top of a hill with great views over the coast, went to the beach,... Next week we'll go cycling!
