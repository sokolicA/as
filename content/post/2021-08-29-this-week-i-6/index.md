Summer is slowly coming to an end so I'm actively spending the last days of August. I wasn't working but I did continue writing my master's thesis. Whilst I do enjoy working on it, I also have trouble finding time for it during these summer days. But the days are getting shorter now and I think it will be easier in September, when I will have plenty of time to finish.

Thursday morning I ran my 4th half marathon (21km). I was quite satisfied with my time, which did improve substantially since July's half marathon. I also signed to a 10 K "night" run (I think the start it at 6 p.m.), which will be held on Oct 2 in Portoro≈æ. Tomorrow will be my first try to assess how fast I can run and last the 10 K. Goal is under 50 min.

Thursday evening I went to Ljubljana with my girlfriend and the next day we went "glamping" near Velika Planina, where we spent the weekend. I wrote about it [here](/2021/08/29/glamping-2021/).
