Last week in October are holidays. For elementary and middle schoolchildren. And many of their teachers and school workers in general, including my girlfriend. But not for me. I don't have many days of paid leave this year and I plan to spend them wisely - in the second half of December. 

So I went  back to Ljubljana and my girlfriend didn't join me since I had lots to do and she wouldn't have much to do meanwhile. I worked the entire week. Mostly thesis' related but also had my first mini-assignment to manually inspect some classifications done by an algorithm. What was different is that there weren't many colleagues at work. In fact I was alone for the first time on Wednesday and I didn't mind it at all. In fact I found the change quite refreshing and relaxing.

I went home on Friday for an extended weekend - Day of the Dead is on Monday. The plan for the weekend was not to have any special plans. The plan was not to do anything work or school related and clear my head off so I can start clean on Tuesday. Also to minimize the use of my phone as much as possible. No Youtube or Facebook or anything like this for the weekend. It's something I've been doing for the last couple of weeks now. My mind doesn't even wonder in those directions anymore and uses my resources for other, more important, thoughts and actions. So I spent the whole weekend with my girlfriend and my family. We watched a new Slovenian series about a young ambitious cook that is faced with not so kind superiors. It's a short and funny series and was ideal for these long afternoons when there's not much to do outside. We also watched psychological thriller The house that Jack built. The movie differs from a standard movie in many aspects and I can't say I was particularly involved it it. Maybe because I was tired and was focusing on staying awake for most of the movie. What I can say though is that a fancy house was built by Jack, who for sure is what you think of when you hear the word psychopath. 

Now that I think of it there were 2 plans that could be thought of as special. And both were on Sunday. First I ran the October's half-marathon in the early morning. I actually ran it in 1 hour and 43 minutes, which is my new PB. I didn't even plan of doing a PB beforehand but then gained the motivation after starting the run - I ran the last half of it at a considerably faster pace and managed to beat my last PB by about 10 minutes. Perhaps I'll set a goal of running it in 90 minutes at the next event I'll be entering. 
After the run I still had energy to bake pizzas for lunch. I was on a break from baking pizzas for the whole summer - I almost quit, because they weren't coming as good as they used to (I think it was because of higher temperatures and the yeast dying before baking). Due to bad experiences I also had a plan B of buying premade dough from a pizzeria in case the first pizza turned out bad. Luckily everything went smooth this time and I baked 3 delicious pizzas. One of the best I ever made. I was glad everyone was happy and enjoying them. I will start baking pizzas more often now, perhaps once a month, when I come home for the weekend.
