Second week of work... Check! Well I mostly worked on my master's thesis but it's atleast midly related to work since I'm using their data. I've finally started modeling. By modeling I already found some errors in the data so I had to go back a few steps and re-make my sample. Thankfully I prepared my workflow in such a way that things like this don't take too long to fix.

I ran 3 times this week - twice in Ljubljana and once in Izola. Every run was part of my training programme - week 6. I've been progressing quite a lot since I started and am able to do the trainings even now that the programme's difficulty is increasing. I've found out it increases when I rate the session very easy.

For the weekend I went home and spent it with my girlfriend and my family. We hang out, went to the city, walked by the sea,... On Saturday we celebrated her mom's birthday in a restaurant called Baščaršija. It's a place where they serve ethno Bosnian cuisine. It's mostly meat from the charcoal grill and dishes from the oven. I had prebranec, which is like a dense stew with white beans, tomatoes. I like the dish and haven't had it in a while so it was no surprise I ordered it. We also tried some fried turkey and plates with mixed meat.

In the evenings we watched Squid game with my girlfriend. We've finished watching episode 6 - we watched 4 episodes. Quite an interesting series. We're already forming our theories about the progression and end of the series. We'll find out soon if any of us were right!
We don't usually order takeway but this weekend we ordered takeaway for dinner on both days. We tried Udon noodles for the first time. They were OK. Tasty, but can't eat too much of them. We also had some fried cheese balls along and I liked them better.

Now I see all I wrote about this week was about work, study, girlfriend, family, running and food!
