This week I got back to work and continued on my project of creating an automated interactive monthly report. In my free time I started creating a data driven CV workflow that will allow easier updates of my CV on my website and for other uses.
On friday I ran a half marathon with 2 friends. Our goal is to run a half marathon every month and this was the 3rd consecutive month since we started in May. On sunday I played tennis after a long time. It was quite enjoyable.
