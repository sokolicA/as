I only spent a few hours at home. I was working on my master's thesis the whole week in Ljubljana. I'm steadily progressing through the data cleaning and sample making process. I found myself going into too much detail and being peculiar about every strange occurence in the dataset. The final dataset is created from different datasets, none of which is of great quality. In my opinion atleast. I may have to continue without correcting all the errors due to time limitations. I will complete the dataset and start the modeling next (actually this at the time of writing) week.

Enough talk about work / school. I continued my 10 K training programme with 2 runs in Ljubljana. I postponed the third scheduled run for next week becaue I had scheduled a half-marathon with 2 friends on Sunday. One friend later cancelled due to having a cold. We went nevertheless and ran a slow pace for a total time of 2 hours and 13 minutes. I was surprised that I wasn't exhausted and had a feeling I could've ran atleast a few kilometers more.

I spent the weekend with my girlfriend in Å alara, Koper. We walked around the city, had some pizza, watched some movies... Then on Saturday morning I help my family harvest grapes (white only, the red ones are not sweet enough). We have just enough grape vines left to keep the tradition going and to have enough wine through the year. I'm not a big fan of wine but it goes well with certain foods. My father says it's healthy in small, moderate doses with a meal. We were happy with the yield. In fact we didn't expect so many grapes (best season in the past 5+ years), so we used some to make grape juice, which came out very good but a bit too sweet for my taste. 

Afterwards we went to an event named Sladka Istra, which was held on a square in Koper. It was organized in a smaller version due to the restrictions but it was very very crowded. You could find all different kinds of desserts. We usually try the safe bets - small desserts in pots (like cheesecake pots, chocolate pots,...). We also tried some special dumplings (pistacchio, ferrero and raspberry/white choc) that tasted phenomenal. I'm a fan of dumplings, especially the home made ones with plums. We started with desserts and ended with takeaway pad thai for my girlfriend and spare ribs that melted in my mouth. The pad thai was delicious as well (I ate like half of it, as usual).

Sunday started with the run I already mentioned, followed by lunch with my family. After I had some time to rest, take our dog for a walk and get get ready for Ljubljana... the drive to which took about 1 hour longer due to heavy traffic. Thankfully I went with my friends so it wasn't that boring. There I unpacked and got my stuff ready for another work-intensive week!
