This one summarizes the last two weeks as not many new things have happened. 
I'm still working from home, mostly on my thesis. I've decided to also put most of the code (or at least the relevant parts of the longer chunks). I can't provide the data I'm using but I think it's good practice to include if someone wishes to check the ideas behind the numbers or perhaps tries to reproduce the analyis with new data and compare the results. Or even to find mistakes, which do happen sometimes.

I've also done some work related stuff. We had to check some registries by hand and see if the data in our tables are outdated. That is some tedious work and would be a total waste of time. Luckily though my mentor got in touch with the guys from the data department and found out we have the data in the warehouse. So it turned out to be an excellent task and I merged the data from both sources and marked the mismatches with the explanation. The results then went into an Excel file that could be filtered and whatnot, just like in the old days.

This Friday we hang out with our friends. We wanted to go iceskating, but we couldn't. There was a long line waiting for since entry limitations. I tried to count and I believe there were fewer than 30 people.. I had a feeling that letting 10 more persons would still be viable. So we just went for a hot drink - coffee, gin, pink gin and whiskey. I liked my winter walker. 
My girlfriend's father invited us out to eat for his birthday. We went to a restaurant that is not far but enough secluded to have thoughts like 'are we going the right way?'. Turned out we were and we were basically the only ones there. Like we booked the place for ourselves. We were there for almost 3 hours that passed by with the blink of an eye. The food was great, we had a mix of seafood and sheep cheese for starters and then truffles, gnocchi, fish, calamari,... and pancakes and dumplings for dessert. We left satisfied :) In the evening we watched a Danish movie Riders of Justice. Interesting movie. Has some thoughts about statistics and how they can change our view of the situation in the wrong way... Where we see non-existing patterns that we want to believe exist.

We also got confirmation that the city's new plans for the usage of the land will allow us to build a house in the hopefully near future. There's still some doubt about the acceptance of the plans and this could all get postponed but we'll try to get it sorted as soon as possible so we can start building!

Last Saturday was the end of my 14 week training programme and I did not complete the 10K race in my goal time as it was very very windy. I underestimated the effect it would have on my running performance and I tried to keep up the pace that I was used to in normal conditions. I ended up getting tired too quickly (also because it's harder to breathe with the wind directly in my face). So I ended in about 48 minutes instead of 45. So I set myself to retry the competition this Saturday. And I've succeeded to run it in just a few seconds shy of 44 minutes. So I've accomplished my goal and now will have 2 weeks with 1 or 2 runs per week. And I'll start my half marathon preparations in January. The marathon is scheduled in the beginning of April and my goal is set to 1 hour and 30 minutes.. Same pace as the 10K, just twice longer.
