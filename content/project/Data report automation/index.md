My task is to create an automated workflow to create monthly and quarterly reports that will be sent to the end users.
The process includes:
 - Merging data from multiple tables in the datawarehouse.
 - Cleaning and preparing data.
 - Making summaries, interactive tables and plots.
 - Presenting data in an interactive HTML document.
 - Automatically sending the reports to selected addresses.
