Sees the 10th post of this type. I believe I started in July and only missed one week and I can't find an excuse why. I've started to enjoy writing this weekly recap and it's becoming a Sunday evening / Monday evening ritual (To be honest it's Tuesday morning as I'm writing this one so that's an option too). I'll probably never read it (at least not any time soon) but reminding myself of the things that happened has perhaps persuaded me to invest my time in a more meaningful way.

There was a lot going on this week. This week marked the end of the student era and the start of my professional career. I got a position as a Data Scientist in one of the biggest banks in the region. I've been receiving scholarship from them during my postgraduate programme of Applied Statistics and together with the job (as a student) it has helped me a lot in expanding my knowledge and allowed me to better explore and find areas of my interest. 

It was also the first time I participated in a run - the "night run" in Portoro≈æ that I've mentioned in one of my previous posts. It was me and 3 friends that signed up for it, 2 of which I run with regularly. I went there with my girlfriend. She went there to support me and cheered for me when I ran past her. My goal was to run the 10 K in less than 45 minutes (4:30 / km on average) and I managed to do it in 4:27 / km even though we started last - literally, because we were late, and had to run past most of the crowd on narrow areas. Towards the end I realized I had a lot of energy to spare and increased the tempo but I realized that a bit too late and came to the finish line not so exhausted as I could've been. At least now I know for my next run I will be aiming towards a pace of 4 minutes per km, which I believe will be possible after some more training. Anyways it was a great event and I was happy I had my first run done (We signed for 21 K runs earlier but they were cancelled due to the ongoing restrictions).

Some quick and easy to digest statistics: 

+ There were about 400 hundred participants total, around half of them went for the 5 K run.
+ Women prevailed in the 5 K run (71 %) and men in the 10 K run (59 %);
+ The oldest competitor was 80 years old and ran the 10 K. He finished last but it's a great accomplishment nonetheless;
+ The youngest runner was a 9 years old girl that finished the 5 K run in 36 minutes; 
+ the pace of many men 5 K participants was slower than the pace of the 10 K participants;
+ The 20th male in the 5 K run would've placed 118th (out of 123) in the 10 K, assuming the same pace;
+ The last in the 5 K would've taken few minutes over 1h 30 min for the 10 K (versus the oldest participant who ran for 1h 10 min);
+ The winner of the 5 K run would've placed 8th in the 10 K run, again assuming the same pace;
+ For women though, the winner of the 5 K ran just a bit slower pace and would've placed 2nd in the 10 K run.

On Sunday I went cycling with my girlfriend - we'd been contemplating to go cycling for a while now. We made a short windy tour to Koper. Afterwards we invited my girfriend's parents for a barbecue. It's something we do every end of summer season. It started to rain before the barbecue but then it soon stopped and it was sunny most of the time. We talked, ate (a lot) and drank some wine.

tl;dr The week was great and full of new experiences!
