I worked from home so I stayed in my hometown. I can already see it's a bit harder to keep a strict schedule while working from home and it's quite easy to get involved in something other than work. I still followed my old routine with going to bed at around 22-23 and waking up around 6 am and started working at 7 am. What I did in the hour inbetween was quite different though. For instance, I took my dog for a walk but I skipped shower. And at home I was in no hurry - I took it easy. And I prefer it that way as I more often than not tend to overthink (everything) and try to do too much.. Which can then build up and stay somewhere and perhaps get covered and rest there forgotten. But still there.

I can see how it can be hard to separate work from free time and it is not hard to get so lost in work that the whole day goes by. That's what I did these days. Except it was mostly for my master's thesis and that it didn't differ much from when I didn't work from home. So that's a plus for me because I didn't have to waste time for commuting,... I really like investigating the dataset I've got and find it quite difficult to stop going further. The analysis has gotten so much better than the first versions. I corrected some of my mistakes, got some other information, found some errors in the data, got new ideas,... Now the return of investigating is shrinking so I will soon stop. Perhaps I'll save my ideas for some further analysis after I've graduated. The subject is broad enough to spend a lifetime doing it. And even if not, the methods learned can be used pretty much anywhere there is some data to be wrangled, analysed,...

I spent the rest of the days with my girlfriend, my family or running. I just realised I didn't even watch a youtube video for the last two weeks. I don't really participate in social media but I like to watch a youtube video here and there. It sometimes helps me clear my mind atleast a bit. 

On Friday we ordered some takeaway pizza from a new pizzeria in town. We tried the pizza named after the pizzeria and it was a different style of pizza. It was like focaccia but much thinner. And everything was put on it fresh. So it was like a light snack. And the box it came in was some strange plastic made box that was designed especially for pizzas. Perhaps to keep it better during the drive. But plastic. So the pizza was better than expected but the box was disappointing and it cost 1.5 eur on top of that. 

On Sunday we drove to Korte, a small town on the hill surrounding Izola. We don't go there often because there's not much to do there and I don't like the road either. But we went there to see how long it takes and to find their school. My girlfriend will have to work there some mornings, starting monday. As we were already there we thought about going for a walk - there were some people walking on the side of the road. We didn't and rather went for a walk by the sea in Izola.

In the evening I hang out with my family in the "summer kitchen" near our house. We lit the small fireplace we got there and my parents made coffee in the traditional turkish coffee-pot on the stove. It smelled very good but I didn't drink it as it was too late. I try to drink all my coffee before noon. After I packed and went to Ljubljana after 2 weeks as I had a dentist appointment on Monday. Don't know when I'll be going back home but I won't stay for long.
